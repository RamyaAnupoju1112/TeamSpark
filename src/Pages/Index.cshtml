    <h1> About us </h1>
    Candidates aspiring to apply for a company can use our application to do due diligence about the
    work sponsorship provided by the organization. Our application would provide users with multiple
    ways to check whether an organization would sponsor their work visa or not. They can search with
    just the company name, the company name with role they are seeking to apply, or just the linked.in
    job post link. We also plan on showing additional statistics about the company’s work visa
    sponsorship.
