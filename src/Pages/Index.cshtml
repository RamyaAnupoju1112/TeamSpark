        About us
    </h1>
    Candidates aspiring to apply for a company can use our application to do due diligence about the
    work sponsorship provided by the organization. Our application would provide users with multiple
    ways to check whether an organization would sponsor their work visa or not. Users can search with
    just the company name, the company name with role they are seeking to apply, or just the linked.in
    job post link.
    <h2>
        Our Story
    </h2>
    As fellow graduate students at Seattle university in 2021, pujith,sagar,sanchita and ramya noticed that There are several challenges 
    international students face while looking for employment opportunities, so we decided to ease up this process and develop a web application which would
    tell you if the company you are seeking a job at would sponsor your work visa.
